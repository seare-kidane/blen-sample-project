# BLEN Sample Project

A `React.JS` application with `Node.JS` backend using `GraphQL`.

- Both backend and frontend codes are written in `TypeScript` and available in their respective directories
- Frontend designed using `React` & `Material-UI` library
- Backend designed using latest version of ApolloServer

Follow the steps bellow to start the servers

1. Run Backend
   Open a terminal and cd to the root directory then run the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd backend/
   npm i
   npm start
   ```

2. Run Frontend
   Open a **second** terminal and cd to the root directory then run the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd frontend/
    npm i
    yarn start
    ```

3. If the above command didn't open a new browser tab automatically, you can manually navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the web interface

Enjoy!
