# BLEN Sample Project

Thanks for your interest.

We are looking for a `React.JS` application with `Node.JS` backend using `GraphQL`. 

## Getting Started

- [ ] The Node.JS application needs to be written in `TypeScript`.
- [ ] We'll be looking for clean code as much as possible.
- [ ] Once done, please commit your code to your repo along with a simple README file.

Good luck

---

## Acceptance Critrea

- [ ] Read the [Sample data](#data) using the [`File system`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module.
- [ ] Integrate `GraphQL` using [`Apollo Server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v1/)
- [ ] Read the data from the `GraphQL` by building a React.JS Functional Component with Redux Hooks for fully managed data.
  - [ ] The listing page should be an HTML table with 3 columns: id, name and age and link the id to a detail page.
  - [ ] The detail page will show all the fields: `company`, `email`, `phone`, `address`.
